How To Create a K3b Release
---------------------------

1. Get "releaseme" script:
   git clone git://anongit.kde.org/releaseme
   cd releaseme

2. Edit "k3brc" file and update "version" entry.

3. Run:
   ./k3b.rb
   The script fetches sources from git repository, translations from SVN and makes a source package.
   On success the script creates a source tarball, e.g. "k3b-2.0.0.tar.bz2".

4. Make sure the version in "CMakeLists.txt", "README", "INSTALL" is valid.

5. Test the tarball. Uncompress and build it. In ideal case the compilation should be performed
   on vanilla environment (without any trace of K3b, minimal requirements with default environment
   variables etc.). After compilation check if the application runs.

6. Upload the tarball to the server (http://sourceforge.net/projects/k3b).

7. Add new version] to the bug tracker (https://bugs.kde.org/editversions.cgi?product=k3b).</li>

8. Write release announcement and publish it on k3b.org]. Update download page.

9. Send an announcement email to:
   * k3b@kde.org
   * kde-extra-gear@kde.org</li>

10. Update K3b status on software sites. Following sites needs an update:
    * Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/k3b)
    * Freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net/projects/k3b)
    * KDE-Apps.org (http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/K3b?content=9875)
